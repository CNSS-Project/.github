### Hi there, Welcome to the CNSS-Project üëã


## About

<p>
The CNSS project‚Äôs main goal is to provide a secure web environment with the ability to do so from a closed domain network. This project‚Äôs motivation all started from not being able to combine the open WWW network and all its functionalities, with the benefits of a secured ‚Äúclosed‚Äù company network.

Having such a solution, can provide and decrease the number of risks that a company or an organization takes, to allow a group of capabilities available only for those who are connected to the world network today.

To reach these goals, a simple solution has been given to achieve the maximum efficiency of an organization‚Äôs day to day operations using the world wide web combined with the proper security it seeks.
